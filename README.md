Problem Scenario:
A Discord community member is struggling to understand the concept of a binary search tree and its operations. They are particularly confused about how to perform an insertion operation in a binary search tree and maintain its properties.

Task:
As a Discord mod and doubt solver specialized in data structures and algorithms, provide a clear explanation of the binary search tree (BST) data structure and guide the member on how to correctly perform an insertion operation while preserving the BST properties.
