# scaler-dsa-challenge

Problem Scenario:
A Discord community member is struggling to understand the concept of a binary search tree and its operations. They are particularly confused about how to perform an insertion operation in a binary search tree and maintain its properties.

Task:
As a Discord mod and doubt solver specialized in data structures and algorithms, provide a clear explanation of the binary search tree (BST) data structure and guide the member on how to correctly perform an insertion operation while preserving the BST properties.

Hints:

Define the binary search tree and its key properties (left child < parent < right child).
Explain the logic behind inserting a new node in a binary search tree and ensuring that the tree remains a valid BST.
Discuss different scenarios that may arise during insertion (e.g., inserting a node with a value already present in the tree) and how to handle them while maintaining the BST properties.
